# 🌩️ Cloudinary Setup Guide for College Clubs Hub

## Overview
This guide will help you set up Cloudinary cloud storage for your College Clubs Hub application. Cloudinary provides reliable, scalable storage for images and videos with automatic optimization and transformation.

## Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account

1. Go to [Cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Click "Sign Up for Free"
3. Choose the **Free Plan** (includes 25GB storage and 25GB bandwidth per month)
4. Complete the registration process

## Step 2: Get Your Cloudinary Credentials

1. After logging in, go to your **Dashboard**
2. You'll see your **Cloud Name**, **API Key**, and **API Secret**
3. Copy these three values - you'll need them for configuration

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

### For Local Development

1. Create a `.env` file in the `college-club-backend` directory:
```bash
# Copy from env.example
cp college-club-backend/env.example college-club-backend/.env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your Cloudinary credentials:
```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-actual-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-actual-api-secret
```

### For Production (Railway)

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add these environment variables:
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` = your cloud name
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` = your API key
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` = your API secret

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Run this command in the `college-club-backend` directory:

```bash
cd college-club-backend
npm install
```

This will install:
- `cloudinary` - Cloudinary SDK
- `multer-storage-cloudinary` - Multer storage engine for Cloudinary
- `dotenv` - Environment variable loader

## Step 5: Test the Setup

### Local Testing

1. Start your backend server:
```bash
cd college-club-backend
npm start
```

2. Open your frontend in a browser
3. Go to the Club Dashboard
4. Try uploading an image or video
5. Check that files appear in your Cloudinary dashboard

### Production Testing

1. Deploy your changes to Railway
2. Test file uploads on your live site
3. Verify files appear in Cloudinary dashboard

## Step 6: Cloudinary Dashboard Features

### Media Library

- **CDN Delivery**: Fast global content delivery
- **Transformations**: On-the-fly image/video processing
- **Scalability**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Free Tier**: 25GB storage + 25GB bandwidth monthly

### 🔧 Features Enabled
- Image compression and format optimization
- Video transcoding and compression
- Responsive image delivery
- Lazy loading support
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Invalid Cloudinary credentials" error
- Double-check your environment variables
- Ensure no extra spaces in the values
- Verify the credentials in your Cloudinary dashboard

#### 2. Files not uploading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CORS settings in your backend
- Ensure file size is under 100MB limit

#### 3. Images not displaying
- Check if URLs are being generated correctly
- Verify Cloudinary folder permissions
- Test with a simple image first

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
```bash
# In your backend, add this temporary log
console.log('Cloudinary config:', {
    cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
    api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY ? 'Set' : 'Missing',
    api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET ? 'Set' : 'Missing'
});
```

2. **Test Cloudinary Connection**:
```javascript
// Add this to your server.js for testing
cloudinary.api.ping()
    .then(result => console.log('Cloudinary connection successful:', result))
    .catch(error => console.error('Cloudinary connection failed:', error));
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to git
- Use strong, unique API secrets
- Rotate credentials regularly

### 2. Upload Restrictions
- File type validation (images/videos only)
- File size limits (100MB max)
- Rate limiting (implement if needed)

### 3. Access Control
- Use signed uploads for sensitive content
- Implement user authentication
- Set appropriate folder permissions

## Cost Management

### Free Tier Limits
- **Storage**: 25GB
- **Bandwidth**: 25GB/month
- **Transformations**: 25,000/month
- **Uploads**: 500/month

### Monitoring Usage
1. Check your Cloudinary dashboard regularly
2. Monitor bandwidth consumption
3. Set up usage alerts if needed

### Upgrading Plans
- **Plus Plan**: $89/month for 100GB storage + 100GB bandwidth
- **Advanced Plan**: $249/month for 500GB storage + 500GB bandwidth
